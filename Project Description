Introduction

  The American Time Use Survey (ATUS), in collaboration with the Food and Nutrition Service (FMS), National Cancer Society (NCI),
  and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BBLS) aims to improve the design of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
  The goal of ATUS is to interview participants and collect data on how they spend 24 hours a day on eating and health activities.
  This data will then be used to make an informed decision on how the SNAP program can be improved. 

Motivation:
  Obesity and overweight are major health conditions recorded in the United States that are predominantly
  caused by poor eating patterns and lack of physical activity. Low-income households seem to have poor health conditions 
  compared to middle-income households.

Project Goal: Our aim is to understand and analyze how groups of individuals incorporate eating and health
  into their daily activities through a relational database. 

Tools Used: MySQL, Tableau Desktop, PHPmyadmin

Analysis Process:
  -Designed an entity-relationship diagram to determine how the database will be created.
  -Created a database using MySQL as a relational database management software and cleaned the data using SQL queries.
  -Connected the created database to the data visualization tool Tableau, using the MYSQL connector.
  -Created research questions for the analysis, then extracted data as per them using SQL queries.

Results:
  -Participants who consume meals & meals and have a high income (1) have an average weight of 76.4 kilograms and low income (5) have an average weight of 78.2 kilograms.
  -It showed that Higher the income level, the better was the Health status.
  -People with the highest income level had the maximum Body Mass Index and vice versa.
  -There wasn't any significant association between frequency of exercise and weights of people.
