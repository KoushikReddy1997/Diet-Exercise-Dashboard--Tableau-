Introduction

The American Time Use Survey (ATUS), in collaboration with the Food and 
Nutrition Service (FMS), National Cancer Society (NCI), and Bureau of Labor 
Statistics (BBLS) aims to improve the design of the Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program (SNAP). The goal of ATUS is to interview participants and 
collect data on how they spend 24 hours a day on eating and health activities. 
This data will then be used to make an informed decision on how the SNAP 
program can be improved. This survey program is conducted every year.

â€¢ There is no centralized repository for accessing all the data gathered on this 
survey. Some sources have copies of this data, and therefore integrity is not 
managed. Every researcher that needs the data needs a database to clean, 
translate and transform the data to their need

Motivation: Obesity and overweight are major health conditions recorded in the 
United States that are predominantly caused by poor eating patterns and lack of 
physical activity. Low-income households seem to have poor health conditions 
compared to middle-income households.

Project Goal: Our aim is to understand and analyze how groups of individuals 
incorporate eating and health into their daily activities through a relational 
database. 
Tools Used: MySQL, Tableau Desktop
